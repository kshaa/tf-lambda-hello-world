# AWS Lambda hello world
A test project to research Terraform & AWS Lambda w/ Python.

## Script hello.py
#### Functionality
1. Main entrypoint (main), when launched as a standalone script:

The hello.py reads an environtment variable 'foo' and prints it out.
If it Ã­sn't defined, an exception message is printed.

2. AWS Lambda entrypoint (lambda\_handler), when imported and executed by AWS Lambda:

Pretty prints Lambda event and context objects, and continues as per main entrypoint

#### Execution
~~~~
export foo="Hello world"
python3 code/hello.py
~~~~

## Terraform deployment
#### Managed inventory
* AWS as the provider (London region)
* AWS Lambda function w/ environment variable 'foo'
* IAM role for the function
* Default IAM lambda trust relationship policy
* Policy extension to allow logging to AWS CloudWatch
* Deployment archive of the python code

#### Deployment
First set up [AWS cli][1] & [access credentials][2]
~~~~
